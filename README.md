# webhook-tests-2

## Purpose
This repository is used for testing out webhooks and their payloads. Specifically, I am testing out the pull_request_review webhooks (and similar ones).

## Contributing
This repository does not accept contributions, as there is no actual code on it.

However, if you are interested enough to contribute, great! We appreciate your time! 
Please submit a feature request if there's anything about this repo that you would like to change. :)

## testing
testing pull requests once again.

another thing. i think i'm ready to move out of draft phase now.
