# webhook-tests-2

## Purpose
This repository is used for testing out webhooks and their payloads. Specifically, I am testing out the pull_request_review webhooks (and similar ones).

## Contributing
This repository does not accept contributions, as there is no actual code on it.

However, if you are interested enough to contribute, great! We appreciate your time!
